# Educational Projects Repository

## About
Serving as a hub for educational projects derived from diverse courses and tutorials, this repository curates a collection of practical applications and demonstrations crafted during my learning journey in programming and game development.

## Course List
1. **C++ Fundamentals: Game Programming For Beginners**
   - Description: This course offers a fun approach to learning C++ through game development, using the Raylib library to focus on pure C++ programming. You'll create various games, learning essential programming concepts along the way, from basic variables and loops to object-oriented programming and game design principles.

## YouTube Tutorials
1. **Snake Game:**
   - Description: Let's build a C++ Snake game with raylib. It is a beginner tutorial. In this game development tutorial In this tutorial, I'll be guiding you step-by-step on how to build your very own Snake game using the C++ programming language and the raylib library and Object Oriented design. We'll start with the basics and work our way up to adding some cool features and making the game look more exciting.

2. **Pong Game:**
   - Description: In this tutorial I am going to show you how to make Pong, a simple but very addictive game where the player controls the right paddle and the computer the left one. We are going to build this game using C++ and the raylib library. At first we are going to build a simple black and white version, just like the original pong of 1973, but at the end of the video we are going to add colors to it, to make it look better. 
   - Although Pong is a very simple game, it covers a lot of the aspects of computer game programming, like movement, control, collision detection, scoring, artificial intelligence and so on. If you learn how to program Pong you will be able to program a lot of other games as well.
